# CleanSlate

The objective of this program is to remove moving objects from a set of pictures of the same scene.
This project is inspired by the following original work.

_Photomontage_ [http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/photomontage/] (http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/photomontage/)

Original work is written in c++ and does a lot more than what I am aiming to achieve with my project. One of features is called 'clean slate'. 

### Examples
These are actual images from the original authors.
